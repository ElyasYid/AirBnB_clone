## FileStorage Class:

This class, located in `models/engine/file_storage.py`, provides functionality for serializing instances to a JSON file and deserializing a JSON file to instances.

### Private Class Attributes:

- `__file_path`: string representing the path to the JSON file (e.g., `file.json`)
- `__objects`: dictionary to store all objects by `<class name>.id` (e.g., `BaseModel.12121212`)

### Public Instance Methods:

- `all(self)`: returns the dictionary `__objects`
- `new(self, obj)`: sets in `__objects` the object with key `<obj class name>.id`
- `save(self)`: serializes `__objects` to the JSON file (path: `__file_path`)
- `reload(self)`: deserializes the JSON file to `__objects` (only if the JSON file (`__file_path`) exists; otherwise, does nothing)

## Initialization:

- Update `models/__init__.py` to create a unique `FileStorage` instance for the application.
- Import `file_storage.py`.
- Create the variable `storage`, an instance of `FileStorage`.
- Call the `reload()` method on this variable.

## BaseModel Class:

- Import the variable `storage` from `models`.
- In the `save(self)` method, call the `save(self)` method of `storage`.
- In the `__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)` method, if itâ€™s a new instance (not from a dictionary representation), add a call to the method `new(self)` on `storage`.

## Command Interpreter

This command interpreter, `console.py`, is designed to provide a set of commands for managing instances of different classes in a JSON file. Below are the commands available and their functionalities:

### create:
Creates a new instance of a specified class, saves it to the JSON file, and prints the instance's ID.


### show:
Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and ID.


### destroy:
Deletes an instance based on the class name and ID, saving the change into the JSON file.


### all:
Prints all string representations of instances based on the class name or prints all instances if no class name is specified.


### update:
Updates an instance based on the class name and ID by adding or updating an attribute, saving the change into the JSON file.
